The Power BI project aims to create an interactive analytical report based on store sales data.
The project uses tables such as: Orders, Cities, Customer, Returns, Product. 

The report allows you to interactively explore sales results and identify key trends and patterns. 
To present the data in a clear way, various visualizations were used, such as column charts, line charts, pie charts and geographical maps.

Example questions answered by the report: 
How do sales change over time? 
Which voivodeships and cities bring the highest sales?
Which month had the highest and lowest sales?
Which customers generate the most revenue?
What is the share of returns in sales?
Which industries dominate sales?
Which shipping type generates the most return value?
How does the value of returns compare to the value of sales in different periods?
